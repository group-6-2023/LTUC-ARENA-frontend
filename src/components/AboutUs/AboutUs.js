        We're LTUC ARENA . We exist to unite the conditioning community.
        <br />
        <br />
        It's not our goals that unite us, but the things we do to achieve them.
        Because although our training grounds and end goals might be different,
        sweat is our sport. And we're a team of individuals who know that to go
        further, we go together.. <br />
        <br />
        LTUC-Arena is a total-body group workout that combines science, coaching
        and technology to guarantee maximum results from the inside out. Our
        workout is not HIIT. It is heart rate-based interval training, where you
        train through 5 heart rate zones designed to charge your metabolism for
        MORE caloric afterburn, MORE results, and MORE confidence, all to
        deliver you MORE LIFE. Orangetheory is more than a gym because the work
        you do here in our studio will make all the difference out there in your
        world.
